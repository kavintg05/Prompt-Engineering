Write a bedtime story about a bat who is afraid of dark for children aged 5 to 7.

## AIM:
To write a bedtime story about a bat who is afraid of dark children aged 5 to 7.

## ALOGORITHM:

STEP-1: Start by deciding the main character of the story (a bat) and its special trait (afraid of the dark).

STEP-2:Create an initial setting (the bat’s cozy cave) and introduce the problem (cold and silence in the cave).
STEP-3:Develop the bat’s journey through different encounters with seemingly scary but friendly characters (owl, snake, bear).

STEP-4: Reveal that the solution to the problem is the “lullaby of light,” symbolizing warmth, friendship, and courage.
STEP-5:  End with the bat overcoming fear, returning home happy, and restoring warmth to his cave.

## PROGRAM:
Pip was a little bat who loved
his cozy cave. It was warm and
safe, full of his family's gentle
snores. But even though bats
love the night, Pip secretly
wished for a tiny lamp to carry
everywhere, because he was
afraid of the dark outside.
One night, a strange chill crept into Pip's cave. The usual chirps and rustles of his bat family faded. His home, usually full of sleepy sounds, became cold and silent. Pip shivered, feeling very alone.
"Oh dear!" squeaked Pip. "Something is wrong! My home needs its warmth back!" He knew he had to be brave. He took a deep breath, puffed out his chest, and fluttered out into the spooky, silent forest.
As he flew, a giant shadow swooped past, and a loud "HOOT!" echoed through the trees. Pip shrieked and quickly hid behind a large, dewy leaf, his heart thumping like a drum. "A monster!" he thought, trembling.
"Who's there, little one?" hooted a soft voice. It wasn't a monster at all! It was Ophelia, a wise old owl with kind, twinkling eyes. "Are you lost?" she asked gently, tilting her head.
Pip explained his cold, silent home. Ophelia nodded. "You need the 'lullaby of light'," she said. "It hums deep in the forest. Follow the sound of the gentle rustle." Pip thanked her and bravely flew on.
Soon, he heard a long, slithery "HISSSSSS!" A long, dark shape moved on the forest floor, weaving through the fallen leaves. Pip gulped. Another monster! He squeezed his eyes shut, ready to fly away as fast as he could.
"Hello there, little friend!" hissed a friendly voice. It was Slinky, a helpful snake, who just loved to slither and sing. "Are you looking for the lullaby?" Slinky pointed with his tail. "It's just over that hill!"
Pip flew faster, following a deep, rumbling hum that grew louder with every flap of his wings. Over the hill, he saw a giant, shadowy shape. It was huge! "The monster!" he thought, trembling. But then, he heard the hum more clearly. It was a warm, gentle song.
It wasn't a monster at all! It was Barnaby, a big, kind bear, humming a beautiful, warm lullaby as he snuggled in his cozy spot. "This is the lullaby of light!" Barnaby rumbled, offering a warm hug. Pip felt brave and warm all over.
Pip hugged Barnaby tightly. "Your hum is so warm!" he squeaked. Barnaby smiled, his eyes twinkling. "It's the warmth of friendship and courage, little one. Take it with you." Pip felt a new kind of warmth growing inside him.
Pip flew home, not afraid of the dark anymore. The "lullaby of light" filled his cave, making it warm and cozy again. His family woke up, chirping happily. Pip knew that even in the darkest night, courage and kindness would always bring light.
